        <h1>Hi</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> Oggy is a cat with two pointy ears, white paws, a body that is blue, and a big red nose. He normally says “hi” by waving and sticking out his bright red tongue. Oggy’s best friend or buddy to always lend an helping hand is Jack. Jack likes fixing things. He fixes vehicles, toys and even Oggy’s alarm clock! Jack has whiskers that are thick and pointy, his ears are short, his body is green, he has grey paws, a big red nose and yellow freckles on his cheek. He has a big truck so when he receives a call, he could go to where the person’s house in a flash.
            The cockroaches are Joey, Marky and Dee Dee. Joey is intelligent and is the leader of the cockroaches. He would ask Marky and Dee Dee to set up traps for Oggy and his friends to get them annoyed or get them into trouble. Marky is the cool guy. He is slim and tall and runs the fastest of all of his “roachmates”[that means, cockroach friends], so he wouldn’t get caught by Oggy. He normally scares Oggy by running up and down pipes to toilets, bathrooms and other pipes and coming out of them. Dee Dee is fat and loves eating even stuff that isn’t food. Dee Dee’s favourite food is everything! Such as chicken,spagetti, bread, fish, meat, vegetables, and everything that he sees, even stuff that isn’t food.</p>
